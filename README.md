# DerpTeX-LaTeX example

In this repository the [DerpTeX-LaTeX](https://github.com/idelsink/derptex-latex) usage is demonstrated.

## steps for: *report*

-   put the [DerpTeX-LaTeX](https://github.com/idelsink/derptex-latex) folder somewhere. (submodule or subdirectory)
-   set the `makefile` variables (buildfolder, derptex-latex folder, latex source, biber source)
-   set the parameters in the `main.tex` (img path, font path)
-   setup a main makefile which refers to all the other makefiles (if using multiple documents of course)

*this list is not all complete, but this is what I had to do.
Use this repo as a reference and you will figure it out... you clever human!*
